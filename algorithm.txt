Algorithm Design:
-------------------

1. Sending Ping Requests:
    
    Input: Hostname or IP address, number of ping requests, and timeout duration.
   
    Algorithm:

  -> Accept user input for the target host, number of ping requests, and timeout duration.
  -> Use a loop to send the specified number of ICMP echo requests to the target host using the ping3.ping() function.
  -> Store the response times in a list.
  -> If a response is received within the timeout period, record the response time. Otherwise, mark the request as timed out.
  -> Repeat steps 2-4 for the specified number of ping requests.
    
    Output: List of response times or "Request timed out" messages.

2. Calculating Packet Loss Rate:

    Input: List of response times.
    
    Algorithm:
  
  -> Count the number of successful pings (response received within the timeout).
  -> Calculate the packet loss rate as the percentage of unsuccessful pings.

   Output: Packet loss rate.


    Pseudo Code:
    -----------
1 .Sending Ping Requests:

Procedure SendPingRequests(host, num_requests, timeout):
    ping_results = []
    For i = 1 to num_requests:
        response_time = ping(host, timeout)
        ping_results.append(response_time)
    Return ping_results

2.Calculating Packet Loss Rate:

Procedure CalculatePacketLoss(ping_results):
    successful_pings = CountSuccessfulPings(ping_results)
    packet_loss_rate = (1 - (successful_pings / num_requests)) * 100
    Return packet_loss_rate


Flowcharts:
----------

1.Sending Ping Requests:


  Start
    |
    V
[Accept user input]
    |
    V
[Initialize ping_results list]
    |
    V
[Loop for num_requests times]
    |
    V
[Send ping request]
    |
    V
[Record response time]
    |
    V
[Add response time to ping_results]
    |
    V
[End of loop]
    |
    V
[Return ping_results]
    |
    V
   End


2.Calculating Packet Loss Rate:

   Start
    |
    V
[Accept ping_results list]
    |
    V
[Count successful pings]
    |
    V
[Calculate packet loss rate]
    |
    V
[Return packet loss rate]
    |
    V
   End


Data Structures and Models:
ping_results: List to store the response times of ping requests.
timeout: Integer or float to specify the timeout duration for each ping request.
PacketLossRate: Float value representing the percentage of packet loss.
