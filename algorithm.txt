Here's a high-level algorithm for the packet loss rate tracking project:

1. Start: Begin the program execution.

2. Display Instructions: Print instructions to the user, explaining the purpose of the application and how to use it.

3. Prompt for Destination: Display a prompt asking the user to enter the destination (IP address or hostname) they want to ping.

4. Get User Input: Read the user input for the destination.

5. Prompt for Packet Count: Display a prompt asking the user to enter the number of packets to send (default is 10).

6. Get Packet Count Input: Read the user input for the number of packets to send. If no input is provided, set the count to the default value (10).

7. Ping Destination: Use the ping utility to send ICMP echo requests to the specified destination for the specified number of packets.
                     Measure the number of packets lost during the ping process.

8.Calculate Packet Loss Rate: Calculate the packet loss rate as a percentage based on the number of lost packets and the total number of packets sent.

9.Display Results: Print the packet loss rate to the user.

10. End: End the program execution.

This algorithm outlines the steps needed to implement the packet loss rate tracking functionality in your Python terminal application. You can translate 
these steps into code, as demonstrated earlier, to create the complete application.
